# BiLSTM-CNN-CRF Implementation for Sequence Tagging
This repository contains a slightly modified version of [https://github.com/UKPLab/emnlp2017-bilstm-cnn-crf/](https://github.com/UKPLab/emnlp2017-bilstm-cnn-crf), used for ASR punctuation in [saarthak-agarwal/Video-Summarization](https://github.com/saarthak-agarwal/Video-Summarization). Refer to the original repository for more information on setup and usage.
